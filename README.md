# Project: Audio Game v0.5

Version in [PT-BR](/README_BR.md)

Welcome!
This repository is a small game being developed in Unity by five game dev students as a challenge attempt to include blind people into the gaming world as well.

## What is this
The game's type is most known as "Audio Game" (as opposed to our more common Video Games) and it's purely based on sounds to guide the player through the obstacles and reaching the final destination.

Your objective here is to reach the destination without touching any of the eletricfied walls only by using your ears.

## How do I play?

You can play it on [itch.io]() soon when all the basics of the game are covered. The game is, yet, at a "tech-demo" level, so expect lots of bugs and missing stuff.

## How to build on Unity?

|Reminder: This repository is actually the "Assets" folder of a blank unity project.|

<ol>
<li> Create an empty project on Unity (Preferable a 2D presset)</li>
<li> Go inside the local files of the project </li>
<li> Open git and clone this repository</li>
<li> Extra: If you prefer, rename the folder to "Assets"</li>
</ol>
